# Loreweave
> **A Future Echoes Project**

Loreweave is a self-hosted campaign management app for tabletop role-playing games.
Its mission is to give Game Masters and players a beautiful, interactive, and private space to store and explore their campaign’s characters, events, locations, and factions

## What you get
- Streamlit app with admin-only editing and player read-only views
- PostgreSQL schema + calendar seed for a 10-month, 36-day/month calendar
- First-run bootstrap page to set campaign name and create the Admin
- `DATABASE_URL` based config (works with Render/Railway/Supabase/Neon/etc.)
- One-click style deploy examples for Render and Railway

##Loreweave lets you:

Track your world — maintain detailed profiles for characters, locations, factions, and events.

Control permissions — players can edit their own characters, while the GM can edit everything.

Stay organised — view timelines, connect characters to events, and browse lore visually.

Run anywhere — deploy in minutes with a free managed database, no setup required.

Customise for your world — set your campaign name, user logins, and calendar on first run.

## Deploy with one click

### Render
- Uses the `deploy/render.yaml` Blueprint to **provision Postgres** and the **web service** automatically.
- After deploy, open the app → complete the **First‑run Setup** (campaign name + admin).

## About Me

I'm Matthew Husselbury, a data analyst with a background in storytelling. Loreweave is a tool I built to support my own campaigns and found it may be of use to other GMs. Feel free to use this for your own campaigns.

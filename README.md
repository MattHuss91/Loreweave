# Loreweave Blank

**Mission Statement**  
Loreweave is a self-hosted campaign management app for tabletop role-playing games.  
Its mission is to give GMs and players a **beautiful, interactive, and private space** to store and explore their campaignâ€™s characters, events, locations, and factions â€” without needing code or third-party accounts.

---

## âœ¨ Quick Summary
- **Track your world** â€” characters, locations, factions, and events with cross-links and searchable dropdowns.
- **Detailed views** â€” select a single character, location, or faction to see a clean, focused profile page.
- **Stay organised** â€” timeline with filters, world-day ordering, and readable dates.
- **Control permissions** â€” GM/Admin edits everything, players edit their own characters.
- **Manage easily** â€” full Admin Tool for creating, editing, deleting, and linking records.
- **No-code deploy** â€” one-click to Render with a free Postgres DB.
- **Custom calendars** â€” one-time setup with your own month names and lengths.
- **Safe changes** â€” deletion actions ask for confirmation before they run.
